Included are sentences that identify, clarify, or restate the underlying analogy or relational pattern, often using phrases like \"So, the relationship is...\", \"So, if X is to Y, then...\", or \"The structure is...\". NOT INCLUDED are sentences that merely brainstorm possible answers, explain background knowledge, or evaluate options without directly mapping the analogy structure. These sentences typically appear after initial comprehension and before or during answer selection, serving to crystallize the analogy's logic for the next reasoning step.",
