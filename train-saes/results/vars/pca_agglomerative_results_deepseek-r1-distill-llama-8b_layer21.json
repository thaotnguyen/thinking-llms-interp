            "For example, if I have 5 apples and I want to group them into 3 piles, I can use 3 twigs (or markers) to show which apples belong to each pile",
            "If I have 5 apples and I make 3 piles, each pile will have fewer apples",
            "For instance, if I have 2 baskets of oranges and each basket has 3 oranges, I can count the total oranges by distributing them into the baskets",
            "If I have a group of objects, say apples, and I want to know how many groups there are, I can use another set of objects to represent the groups",
            "For example, if I have 3 groups of 2 apples and I add another group of 2 apples, I now have 4 groups of 2 apples each",
            "For example, if I have 2 rows of 4 apples each, the total is 8 apples",
            "So, if I have 5 of something and I do it 3 times, it's like adding 5 three times",
            "If I have a certain number of objects in rows and columns, the total number of objects is the product",
            "I can show this by distributing the apples into each group",
            "Maybe by showing how adding a group to each existing group increases the total count",
            "I can show this by having no apples in any group, which means the total is zero",
            "This visual representation can help students understand that multiplying 5 by 3 means adding 5 three times",
            "I can explain that multiplying is like adding the same number multiple times",
            "If I multiply by zero, there's nothing to add, so the result is zero",
