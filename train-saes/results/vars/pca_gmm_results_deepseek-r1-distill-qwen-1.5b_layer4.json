          "description": "This function involves explicitly performing and narrating arithmetic calculations step by step, often breaking down complex expressions into simpler operations (e.g., multiplication, division, addition, exponentiation) and sometimes verifying intermediate results. Included are sentences that show the LLM working through numeric computations in detail, such as multiplying numbers, dividing, or calculating factorials, often with intermediate results stated. Not included are sentences that merely state a formula, set up an equation, or discuss conceptual reasoning without actually carrying out the arithmetic. These sentences typically appear in the middle of the reasoning process, immediately after a formula or calculation is set up and before the final answer is synthesized.",
