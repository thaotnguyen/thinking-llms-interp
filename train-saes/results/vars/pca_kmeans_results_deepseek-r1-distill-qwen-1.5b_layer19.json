Specifically, they explain *how* or *why* one factor leads to another, often using connective language such as \"so,\" \"because,\" \"which means,\" or \"leading to,\" and frequently involve chains of cause-and-effect or underlying physical/chemical/biological mechanisms. INCLUDED are sentences that explicitly describe the process or mechanism by which an input or condition produces an outcome (e.g., \"If the room is colder, it can transfer more heat, so the tea cools faster\"). NOT INCLUDED are sentences that merely state facts, definitions, or outcomes without explaining the underlying process, or those that speculate, hypothesize, or set up the problem without detailing the causal link. These sentences typically appear in the middle of reasoning traces, after initial problem setup and before final conclusions, as the model works through the logic connecting premises to outcomes.",
