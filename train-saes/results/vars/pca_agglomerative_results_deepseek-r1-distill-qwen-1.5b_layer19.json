They mark a cognitive shift from general understanding or confusion to a structured analytical approach, often using phrases like \"let me break this down,\" \"let me think about this step by step,\" or \"let me try to visualize it.\" INCLUDED are statements that announce the intent to analyze, decompose, or reconsider the problem; NOT INCLUDED are the actual analytical steps, conclusions, or summaries themselves. These sentences typically appear at transition points\u2014either at the beginning of reasoning, when encountering confusion, or when preparing to reframe or double-check the reasoning process.",
