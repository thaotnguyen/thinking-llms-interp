          "These sentences articulate the underlying mechanism or causal process that links an observed phenomenon to its explanation, often using phrases like \"because,\" \"so,\" \"when,\" or \"if...then.\" Included are statements that describe how or why something happens by detailing the sequence of events, interactions, or physical/chemical/biological processes involved (e.g., \"When the air sinks, it warms up and can't hold as much moisture, so clouds don't form\"). Not included are mere statements of fact, definitions, high-level summaries, or statements expressing uncertainty or speculation without specifying a mechanism. These sentences typically appear in the body of reasoning, following an initial question or observation and serving to build or justify the explanation."

            "This process traps heat in the atmosphere, making the Earth's surface warmer than it would be otherwise",
            "That makes sense because the lower pressure means it's easier for the water molecules to escape into the air, so they don't need as much energy, hence a lower boiling point",
            "This happens because the salt particles (ions, actually) increase the solution's vapor pressure, requiring a higher temperature for the liquid to reach its boiling point",
            "That makes the cells on the shaded side grow faster, causing the plant to bend towards the light",
            "The rising air cools down, and since it can hold more moisture, it condenses into clouds, leading to rain or snow",
            "So, more thermal energy is needed to provide the necessary kinetic energy for the molecules to break free from the liquid and into the gas, especially when the surrounding pressure is higher",
            "Then, they radiate this warmth back in all directions, including towards the Earth's surface",
            "So when light hits a metal, the free electrons can interact with the photons, causing them to reflect",
            "When there's more auxin on one side, those cells elongate more, making that side longer and causing the plant to curve towards the light source",
            "If the electrons in the material can absorb the energy from the photons, then the material absorbs the light",
            "When these gases absorb the radiation, they become excited, and then they emit the energy, but in different directions",
            "I think that's because when the air sinks, it warms up and can't hold as much moisture, so clouds don't form",
            "So, when the compressor compresses the refrigerant, it turns into a hot gas, and then the condenser coils cool it down by releasing that heat to the surrounding air"
