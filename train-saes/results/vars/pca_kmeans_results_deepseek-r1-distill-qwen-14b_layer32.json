          "description": "These sentences explicitly caution against or refute the logical error of assuming that the converse of a conditional statement is true (i.e., from \"If A, then B,\" incorrectly inferring \"If B, then A\"). This function includes statements that clarify the limits of what can be concluded from a one-way implication, often using examples or analogies to illustrate that the presence of the consequent (B) does not guarantee the antecedent (A). It does NOT include general explanations of conditional logic, affirmations of valid inferences, or statements that simply restate the original implication; rather, it specifically addresses and negates the mistaken reversal of logical direction. These sentences typically appear after the initial statement of a conditional relationship, serving as a corrective or clarifying step in the reasoning process.",
