          "description": "These sentences explicitly signal the model's uncertainty, doubt, or lack of confidence regarding the validity, correctness, or appropriateness of a proposed answer, hypothesis, or reasoning step. Included are statements that hedge, qualify, or question whether a just-suggested idea is correct, relevant, or intended (e.g., \"But I'm not sure if that's the intended answer,\" \"But I'm not sure how that would work\"). NOT included are sentences that merely state ignorance (\"I don't know\"), request more information, or express uncertainty about facts not directly tied to a candidate solution. These sentences typically appear immediately after the model proposes or considers a possible answer or reasoning path, serving as a self-monitoring or metacognitive check before proceeding.",
