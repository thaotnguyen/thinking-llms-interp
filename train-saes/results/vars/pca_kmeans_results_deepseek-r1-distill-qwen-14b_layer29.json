Included are statements that clarify why a condition being necessary does not make it sufficient, or why the presence of an effect does not guarantee a specific cause, often using conditional logic (if P then Q) and its converse (if Q then P). Not included are sentences that merely restate facts, describe patterns, or introduce new information without evaluating logical sufficiency or addressing the directionality of implication. These sentences typically appear after the problem is restated and the premises are analyzed, serving as the critical step where the reasoning process tests or refutes the validity of a proposed inference.",
