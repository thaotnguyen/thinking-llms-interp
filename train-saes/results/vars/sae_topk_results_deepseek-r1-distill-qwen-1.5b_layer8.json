          "title": "Step-by-Step Arithmetic Computation",
          "description": "These sentences perform explicit, stepwise calculations of arithmetic expressions, often breaking down complex operations (such as multiplication, division, exponentiation, or combinatorial formulas) into smaller, manageable parts and showing intermediate results. INCLUDED are sentences that walk through the numeric computation process in detail, such as multiplying numbers sequentially, dividing results, or simplifying fractions, often with phrases like \"Let me compute that,\" \"Calculating step by step,\" or \"So, X * Y = Z.\" NOT INCLUDED are sentences that merely state a formula, set up an equation, or discuss conceptual strategies without actually carrying out the arithmetic. These sentences typically appear in the middle of reasoning traces, immediately after a formula has been established and before the final answer is synthesized.",
