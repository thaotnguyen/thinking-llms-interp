              "These sentences perform a conditional reasoning step by posing \u201cif\u2009\u2026\u2009then\u201d scenarios to explore what might happen under different circumstances, often using modals (\u201cmight,\u201d \u201ccould\u201d) to express tentative outcomes. They systematically vary a single factor or assumption (e.g., \u201cIf the pressure is too low, the speaker might not speak, and if it\u2019s too high, it might cause issues\u201d) in order to test implications, edge cases, or causal dependencies. Included are explicit condition\u2013consequence constructions that probe the effects of altering parameters or contexts. Not included are pure uncertainty admissions without conditionals, planning or action\u2010sequence statements, or simple recall of factual definitions."

              "These sentences serve to bring relevant domain-specific facts, theories, authors, or definitions into the conversational context. They often begin with memory cues (\u201cI recall,\u201d \u201cI remember,\u201d \u201cAnother thought,\u201d \u201cI know that\u201d) and reference specific philosophical works, psychological constructs, or ethical principles without yet applying or testing them. What\u2019s included are explicit recollections of named theories, texts, or conceptual distinctions (e.g. Rawls\u2019s original position, Kant\u2019s categorical imperative, Hardy-Weinberg equations). What\u2019s not included are forward-looking plans, uncertainty hedges about next steps, formal deductions, or the introduction of new assumptions\u2014these sentences strictly surface existing knowledge for later reasoning."

              "These sentences function as brief meta-cognitive interruptions signaling the reasoner to pause and reconsider or verify what was just said. They begin with cues like \u201cWait,\u201d \u201cBut hold on,\u201d or \u201cWait, no,\u201d and are followed by indications of uncertainty about units, missing information, potential errors, or the need to rethink a formula or premise. They do not advance the argument by introducing new data, hypotheses, or planned steps; rather, they initiate an internal check or clarification of the immediately preceding reasoning. This category excludes full uncertainty statements (\u201cI\u2019m not sure about the overall conclusion\u201d), forward-looking plans (\u201cNext I will calculate X\u201d), or substantive content recall (\u201cRecall that area = \u03c0r\u00b2\u201d)."
