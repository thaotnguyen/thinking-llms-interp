            "Gases expand when heated because their molecules have more energy and push against the walls of the balloon more, making it bigger",
            "Maybe the molecules in honey are arranged in a way that makes it harder for them to move past each other, increasing the viscosity",
            "For example, when ice melts, the hydrogen bonds between water molecules break because the energy from heat provides the energy needed to overcome those bonds",
            "Maybe temperature affects the solubility by influencing the kinetic energy of the molecules, making them move around more and interact better with water",
            "When you heat a substance, the particles gain kinetic energy, which makes them move more",
            "Wait, I think it's because the medium's particles are more densely packed in solids, so the sound wave can move through them more quickly",
            "If the medium is more elastic, it can store and release energy more effectively, which allows the sound wave to travel farther and maintain its shape better",
            "Maybe it's about how easily heat can move through the material\u2014lower thermal conductivity means less heat transfer, so better insulation",
            "Metals might reflect more because their electrons can move and respond to the light, while insulators absorb more because their electrons are stuck",
            "In air, the electrons in the air molecules slow it down a bit because they interact with the electric field of the light",
            "Some materials might conduct better when they're heated because the increased temperature gives the electrons more energy to move around",
            "If the object is a good conductor, like metal, the heat should transfer quickly, so it might feel colder because it's taking the heat away from your hand",
            "That makes some sense because stretching would increase the distance between molecules, possibly increasing the surface area where friction can occur, leading to more heat",
            "Or maybe materials with a high surface area to volume ratio, like metals, are better conductors because they have more pathways for heat to move",
            "On the other hand, dark colored materials like black absorb light, which might be because their electrons can't easily move to match the light's energy"
