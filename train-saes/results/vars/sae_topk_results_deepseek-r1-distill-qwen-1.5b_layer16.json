These sentences serve to crystallize the inferred relationship after prior analysis, summarizing the mapping in a clear, declarative form. INCLUDED are sentences that directly articulate the analogy or the relationship being drawn, often as a conclusion or synthesis; NOT INCLUDED are exploratory, speculative, or analytical steps leading up to this mapping, or sentences that merely describe features of the items without stating the analogy. These sentences typically appear after the reasoning or analysis phase, serving as a capstone or summary of the analogy resolution process.",
