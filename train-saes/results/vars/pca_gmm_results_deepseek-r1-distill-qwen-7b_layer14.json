          "description": "These sentences serve the function of proposing possible explanations, scenarios, or interpretations to account for the facts or constraints of a problem, often using language like \"maybe,\" \"perhaps,\" \"alternatively,\" \"or,\" or \"wait.\" This category includes the explicit formulation of alternative solutions or storylines, often in rapid succession, and sometimes includes brief evaluation or rejection of each. It does NOT include the final selection of an answer, detailed step-by-step deduction, or mere clarification of the problem statement; rather, it occupies the exploratory middle phase of reasoning, typically after initial understanding but before final conclusion.",
