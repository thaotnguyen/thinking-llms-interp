          "description": "These sentences serve the function of generating possible downstream effects or consequences that could result from a given scenario, action, or change. Included in this category are statements that use conditional or modal language (e.g., \"if... might/could/would...\") to speculate about what may happen as a result of a prior premise, often exploring both positive and negative outcomes. This function does NOT include explanations of current facts, definitions, or direct evaluations; it is specifically about projecting hypothetical future states or ripple effects, and these sentences typically appear after an initial premise or scenario has been established, forming the exploratory or elaborative phase of reasoning.",
