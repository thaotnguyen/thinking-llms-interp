Each sentence names a physical, chemical, or mathematical formula without yet applying it to a specific problem or deriving it. Included are bare equations and introductory phrases like \u201cThe formula is\u2026\u201d or \u201cI remember that\u2026\u201d. Not included are steps where the formula is manipulated, numerically evaluated, justified from first principles, or used to draw a conclusion."

Included are hesitations and metacognitive cues (\u201cwait,\u201d \u201cbut,\u201d \u201clet me think\u201d), hedging language (\u201cmaybe,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201ccould be\u201d), admissions of uncertainty or mixing things up (\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m mixing up formulas\u201d), and intentions to verify or rederive (\u201cI should look up,\u201d \u201clet me recall,\u201d \u201clet me clarify\u201d). Not included are definitive solution steps, final conclusions, or the introduction of entirely new problem-solving plans without reference to correcting the current thread."
