They often introduce or explain related ideas, frameworks, or influences (e.g., psychological theories, social factors, economic models) that might bear on the reasoning process, but do not directly advance the argument, make a decision, or evaluate options.

It includes sentences that expand on possible influences, mechanisms, or theoretical perspectives, but does NOT include those that directly weigh options, state conclusions, or recount the reasoning steps taken.",
