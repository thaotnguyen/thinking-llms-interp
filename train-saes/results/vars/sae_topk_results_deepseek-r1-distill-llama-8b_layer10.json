          "description": "These sentences serve to propose, elaborate, or speculate about underlying mechanisms, causal relationships, or physical processes that explain observed phenomena or answer \"why/how\" questions. Included are statements that describe how entities, properties, or variables interact (often using terms like \"because,\" \"so,\" \"if...then,\" \"maybe,\" \"for example,\" or \"when...\"), and that hypothesize about possible mechanisms or causal chains. NOT INCLUDED are sentences that merely state facts, recall definitions, restate the question, enumerate options, or summarize conclusions. These sentences typically appear in the middle of reasoning traces, after the problem is understood but before a final answer is given, as the model explores and tests possible explanations.",

            "Gases expand when heated because their molecules have more energy and push against the walls of the balloon more, making it bigger",
            "Maybe temperature affects the solubility by influencing the kinetic energy of the molecules, making them move around more and interact better with water",
            "At higher pressure, the water molecules are pushed together more, so they have to overcome that pressure to become a gas",
            "So the water molecules start moving faster as they absorb heat, which makes the water feel warmer",
            "When you heat a substance, the particles gain kinetic energy, which makes them move more",
            "For example, when ice melts, the hydrogen bonds between water molecules break because the energy from heat provides the energy needed to overcome those bonds",
            "The ice crystals break apart because the particles have more energy when heated, right",
            "Maybe the molecules in honey are arranged in a way that makes it harder for them to move past each other, increasing the viscosity",
            "Some materials might conduct better when they're heated because the increased temperature gives the electrons more energy to move around",
            "So, more pressure means the molecules are more tightly packed, needing more energy to escape, which would be a higher temperature",
            "When the pressure is high, the upward movement of the air is slower, so clouds don't form as easily",
            "Is it because the particles in solids are closer together, so the wave can move faster",
            "Wait, I think it's because the medium's particles are more densely packed in solids, so the sound wave can move through them more quickly",
            "In air, the electrons in the air molecules slow it down a bit because they interact with the electric field of the light",
            "Maybe it's about whether the material has free electrons that can move around when a field is applied"

This function includes only the direct retrieval or assertion of such canonical information, not the application, manipulation, or inference based on these facts.
