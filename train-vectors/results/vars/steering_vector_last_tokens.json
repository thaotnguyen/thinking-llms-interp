So, the activation of the autonomic nervous system, specifically the sympathetic part, might be the answer.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes it's referred to as the \"erection\" system, which might be a specific term. I'm not sure if it's called the autonomic nervous system or something else. Maybe it's the peripheral nervous system? No, that doesn't sound right because the peripheral nervous system is more about sensory functions.\n\n",
